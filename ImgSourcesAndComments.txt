I can't find how to upload image files so I'll just give you the imgur.com links.

Or you can make them yourself in paint. Just a blank 200X50 canvas and paint tool.

You could also use your own images and just edit the relevant sources. purple.png is the default image and red.png is the swapped image on hover.

I looked through the markup and code and tried to add some modularity: HTML is the structure and content, CSS is the form, and jQuery is the function. I also tried to preserve what was originally intended and didn't edit the structure or edit single tag elements to be single (<img/>) because I didn't know if you wanted to put something there.

I will try to make a similar layout in ASP.NET later today. This is pretty fun.

Also, I can't find how to make folders so pardon the clutter.
